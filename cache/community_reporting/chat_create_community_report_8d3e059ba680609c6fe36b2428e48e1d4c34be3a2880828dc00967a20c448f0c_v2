Functions enable structured programming and code reuse by organizing related operations into callable units. They can accept various types of parameters, including positional and keyword arguments, and can return results of different data types. Functions are often stored in modules for better code organization and can be imported and invoked as needed. This modular approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and development efficiency, making functions indispensable in Python programming [Data: Entities (0); Relationships (0)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Formal parameters (形参) define function interfaces\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Formal parameters ('形参') are variables declared in a function's definition to receive input values when the function is called.

Parameters can be standard variables, or they can use special syntax like *args and **kwargs to accept arbitrary numbers of positional or keyword arguments. Default values can be assigned to parameters, making them optional and increasing the flexibility of function calls.

This feature simplifies function usage by making certain parameters optional, reducing the need for callers to specify every argument.
