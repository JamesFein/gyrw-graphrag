When a function is designed to process multiple values, a list can be passed as an actual parameter to provide the function with the necessary data. This means that \"实参\" can be a \"列表\", and functions often use lists as their input to perform operations such as iteration, aggregation, or transformation on the elements of the list.\n\nTherefore, \"实参\" and \"列表\" are closely related in the context of function calls and data handling in programming. Lists are often used as actual parameters, and understanding how to use lists as arguments is an important aspect of programming.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751034882, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_799e4ca3f1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 221, "prompt_tokens": 153, "total_tokens": 374, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
