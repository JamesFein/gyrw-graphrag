A \"函数\" is a block of code designed to perform a specific task, and it often requires input values to operate. These input values are represented by \"形参\", which are variables defined in the function's declaration or definition to receive the values provided during a function call. In this relationship, a \"函数\" CONTAINS \"形参\", meaning that formal parameters are part of the function's structure. Additionally, \"形参\" HAS_PROPERTY, indicating that formal parameters possess certain attributes, such as a name, data type, and scope within the function. Together, these entities illustrate how functions are constructed to accept and utilize input through formal parameters, enabling modular and reusable code.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751034882, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_799e4ca3f1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 151, "total_tokens": 313, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
