The relationship between these entities is that \"默认值\" (default value) is a property that \"形参\" (formal parameter) can have. In other words, a formal parameter may have a default value specified, which will be used if no corresponding argument is provided during the function call. This relationship can be described as \"形参\" belongs to a function and has the property of \"默认值\", meaning that default values are an attribute or property of formal parameters within function definitions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751034883, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_799e4ca3f1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 195, "prompt_tokens": 162, "total_tokens": 357, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
